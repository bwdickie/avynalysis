# avynalysis
Sample code for avalanche forecasting using a random forest classifier.

The repository contains a single Python notebook (avynalysis.ipynb) that provides an end-to-end example of building a classification model to predict the severity of avalanche forecasts in the High Sierras. All details on the data sources, approach, etc. can be found in this notebook.

To supplement this analysis in Python, I created a Tableau workbook that provides additional visualizations on the weather data and model deployent to make real-time predicitions. The dashboards can be accessed at the following site: http://avalanche-research-model.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
