# avynalysis
Sample code for avalanche forecasting using a random forest classifier.

The repository contains a single Python notebook (avynalysis.ipynb) that provides an end-to-end example of building a classification model to predict the severity of avalanche forecasts in the High Sierras. All details on the data sources, approach, etc. can be found in this notebook.
